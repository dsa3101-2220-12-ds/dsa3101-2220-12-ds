CZ1003,Introduction to Computational Thinking & Programming,Computer Science,1,"Computational thinking (CT) is the process of analysing a problem then designing and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as programs running on computer. The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. Student will also learn about basic program construct and simple data structures. In addition, the course will include topics to appreciate the internal operations of a processor.","1. Describe the internal operation of a basic processor, how a program is executed by a computer and computing trends. 2. Analyse a problem then design and express its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. (i.e. equip you with CT skills) 3. Implement problem solutions as programs using basic control structures (sequence, conditional, iterative). 4. Implement problem solutions as programs using basic data types and aggregate data types. 5. Apply the CT concepts on case studies/problem‐based scenarios through hands‐on practice of the CT processes.","0

CC0001,Inquiry and Communication in an Interdisciplinary World,Other,1,"Writing is a tool for thinking. Through the process of organising our thoughts into words, we often stumble upon ideas and figure out what we mean. At its best, this process yields new insights. One of the aims of this course is to give you this experience of discovering ideas through the process of writing. While you will have the opportunity to practise the genre conventions of your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of thinking that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational coursewill develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyse texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.","1. closely observe and analyse texts and phenomena;

8. recognize audience and rhetorical situation as significant factors in communication","In this course, students will be asked to explore a topic for their own research. The choices are: 1. a place in Singapore; 2. a community within Singapore; 3. their own writing practices. Students will investigate their chosen topic by close observation, recording their observations, and finding interesting patterns or puzzles in what they observe. In class, students will practice how to come to a question to which they do not have an answer, and, after a review of presentation skills, students will present their discoveries to the class. Eventually, students will be asked to find two sources that can help them compose an argument that responds to their question. The final goal is to draft an op-ed (short for “opposite the editorial page”), a piece of writing usually found in a newspaper or magazine that expresses the author’s argument on a current topic. Students’ op-eds will be peer workshopped and revised substantially over two to three weeks. Students will also consult with their teacher and receive individual feedback on their draft.

complexity and maintainability issues in software systems. We want students to establish an object-

the separation of design from implementation; the use of inheritance and polymorphism. You will
discover how to describe these concepts using appropriate UML diagrams. Finally, you will also learn
