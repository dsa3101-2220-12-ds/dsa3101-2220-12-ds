database backup, recovery and security.","ICT330 Database Management Systems introduces students to relational databases, data 
modelling and the theory of relations as applied to the representation of models of data. The 
aim of this course is to equip students with an understanding of database systems concepts and 
in particular, using and then designing both read-only and updateable relational databases. The 
data sublanguage SQL, covered in practical lab sessions using a database management system 
such as Oracle Database system, includes both SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) for the 
implementation of the physical database from the Logical Data Model and Data Manipulation 
Language (DML) for data manipulation and query. The implementation of database objects 
such as views, triggers and stored procedures using SQL procedural extensions to fulfill 
business requirements are also explored in practical lab sessions. The system administration of 
multi-user database systems will also be covered to address issues such as concurrency, 
database backup, recovery and security."
