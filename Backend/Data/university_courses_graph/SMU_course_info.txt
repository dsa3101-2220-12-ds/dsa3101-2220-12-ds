• Market Analysis
Which is the company’s market share in different geographical areas?  Where are the customers located?  What are the characteristics of customers in different geographical locations?  Are there potential customers and where do they live? 
• Site Selection
Where are the shops or branches of the company located today?  Where are the competitors located?  What would be the surrounding market area for a new location?  What are the socio-economic characteristics of the people living in this market area?  Will the establishment of a new shop interfere with the existing shop owned by the company?  Are the land prices in different areas suitable for building a new shop?
• Sales territories
Which the company’s present division into sales territories?  What kind of customers live in these districts and how much is sold?  Is there a need for more salesmen in any district?  Could redistricting lead to more efficient sales organisation and less travelling time for the salesmen?
• Distribution and travel costs
How can the distribution system be made more efficient?  In what way does the transport system influence the distribution and how does it restrict or facilitate expansion in the region?  Can the number of journeys made by company staff be reduced by applying route planning software?  Are there any alternatives to our present distribution system?
• Analysis of the global environment and new export markets
What is the general economic and spatial pattern in the region?  How good is the infrastructure?  How is the population distributed geographically?  Which other companies are present in the region and where are they located?  Is this region a potential export market for the company’s products?
